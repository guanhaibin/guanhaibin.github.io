Hello, Here is who I am & what I do

I'm a biomedical data analyst and data scientist, welcome to my personal blog to keep track of my projects and personal journey towards biomedical data analysis.


I translate biomedical data into valuable and comprehensible knowledge that can revolutionize the diversity of health care.
I am experiences in machine learning, data science, biostatistics, and bioinformation
I enjoy doing research in metabolomics, genomics and other multi-omics. I believe that a multi-omics apprach can uncover deeper biological context to disease-causing variants and accelaerate our understanding of common disorders,
unlock new pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets.
