# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  As a biomedical data analyst and data scientist, I translate biomedical data into valuable and comprehensible knowledge can revolutionize the diversity of health care.
  I am experiences in machine learning, data science, biostatistics, and bioinformation
  I enjoy doing research in metabolomics, genomics and other multi-omics. I believe that a multi-omics apprach can uncover deeper biological context to disease-causing variants and accelaerate our understanding of common disorders,
  unlock new pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets.
