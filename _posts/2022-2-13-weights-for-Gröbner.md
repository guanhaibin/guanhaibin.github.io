We consider a specific class of polynomial systems that arise in parameter identifiability problems of models of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and discover a method for speeding up the Gröbner basis computation by using a weighted ordering. Our method explores the structure of the ODE model to generate weight assignments for each variable. We provide empirical results that show improvement across different symbolic computing frameworks.
